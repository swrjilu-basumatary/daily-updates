            <b><u>Design and Styling</u>:</b>
            <br><br> 
            The Honda CB300F features an aggressive and sporty design, reminiscent of its larger CB siblings.
             The bike boasts sharp lines, a muscular fuel tank with extensions, and a sleek LED headlamp that
              gives it a contemporary streetfighter look. The minimalistic tail section, split seats, and 
              alloy wheels add to its modern aesthetics, making it stand out on the road.

              <b><u>Engine and Performance</u>:</b>
              <br><br>

              At the heart of the CB300F is a 293cc, single-cylinder, oil-cooled, fuel-injected engine.
               This engine produces a maximum power of 24.4 PS at 7,500 RPM and a peak torque of 25.6 Nm
                at 5,500 RPM. The engine is paired with a 6-speed gearbox, ensuring smooth and responsive 
                gear shifts. The bike’s performance is characterized by a strong mid-range, making it suitable
                 for both city commuting and spirited highway riding. The inclusion of a slipper clutch enhances 
                 the riding experience by reducing rear-wheel lock-up during aggressive downshifting.

            footpeg placement. The seat is well-cushioned, providing ample comfort for long rides. The suspension
             setup includes telescopic forks at the front and a mono-shock at the rear, ensuring a balanced and
