           If you look at the exterior you can see the fog lamps in Seltos, which are not available in Creta.

            <b><u>TYRES</u>:-</b>
            There is a big difference in the tyre size Hyundai Creta comes in 17 inches and Seltos comes in 18 inches alloys.
            <br>
            <br> 
            So, if you want to drive on the bumpy roads or villages. Then Creta Hyundai is best for you  because another
            advantages of Creta is the Approach and departure angle the ground clearance is more or less the same. But the 
            approach angle is better in Creta because it's protruding slightly out in the Seltos. So it can be touched in some 
            places. There are less chances of getting touched in Creta. There is no difference in the keys. The key comes 
            with more or less the same features. Both have got 4 buttons. You can start the car from outside. So, there is no 
            difference in the keys. There's is no difference in the side too, you get a 360 degree camera in both. Obviously 
            There is difference in looks. You can see it according to your taste. you get discs in both as well.

            <b> <u> INTERIOR </u>:-</b> 
            There are some changes in the interior, <br>
            The main difference here which is rarely noticed by the people is the one-touched up-down for all windows it is available in 
            kia but not available in creta. Only the driver gets one-touched up-down in creta. You have to press the rest of 
            the windows.
            <br><br>
            <div class="img">
                <div class="img2">
                </div>
            </div>
             <br>
             <br>
             The screen of seltos is flat from below, there is dual-zone elimate control, if we talk about the management it is better 
             than creta. The wireless charger is placed above. YOU can choose multiple types of interior in seltos, rest you get
             6 air bags in it. Rear sun shade in it. Ventilated Seats in it. Bose's music system etc. There is no change in it as such.  
         </p>

              <div class="img">
                <div class="img3"></div>
              </div>
              So, in seltos there sre three engine options 1.5 NA, 1.5 diesel, 1.5 Turbo in these 3 engines you get one more transmission 
              option with an automatic. like in seltos you get diesel with IMT but in this you get mannual In seltos you get CVT and manual 
              with the naturally aspirated. In creta you get CVT and manual. In seltos you get turbo with IMT and DCT . In creta, you get only 
              DCT. one more extra in Creta is magnetic pad.
